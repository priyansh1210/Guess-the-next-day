## 🎮 About the App

**Guess The Next Day** is a fun little web app that “calculates” the next day of the week —  
using extremely advanced techniques like:

- Consulting **time wizards** 🧙‍♂️  
- Bribing the **calendar gods** 💰  
- Hacking into **NASA’s database** 🚀  
- And occasionally, asking a **hamster** 🐹  

You pick a day.  
It “processes” with some hilarious loading messages.  
And voilà — it tells you the next day! (Spoiler: it’s always right 😎)

## 🧠 Tech Stack

- **HTML5** + **CSS3** for the simple and clean UI  
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** for all the “AI” magic  
- **Pure imagination** for the loading logic ✨

1. Open the app.  
2. Select any day from the dropdown.  
3. Hit **“Guess”** (or press **Enter**).

6. Press **Escape** anytime to reset.
